#Covid-19 data
This data is dayly scrapped from the Generalitat de Catalunya [SARS-CoV-2 dashboard](http://aquas.gencat.cat/ca/actualitat/ultimes-dades-coronavirus) via [this](https://github.com/ibesora/covid-19-scrapper) scrapper

**Notice:** Seeing that the data is being constantly updated during the day I've automated the scrapper to run each day at midnight so we get the complete data of that same day. As a consequence, the first day of data, scrapped on 2020-03-28 has been flagged as 2020-03-27 data.
